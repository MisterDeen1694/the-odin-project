        <p>Some simple decorating with drizzled white chocolate and an icing pen turns scrumptious white chocolate truffles into these adorable Halloween-themed mummies. The whole family will love the novelty factor as well as the decadent sweet flavour.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>200 g white chocolate</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cream</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla essence</li>
            <li>1 cup desiccated coconut</li>
            <li>200 g white chocolate melts</li>
            <li>1 black writing icing</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chocolate and cream in a heat-proof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water. Stir until melted. Remove from heat and stir through vanilla and coconut. Refrigerate for 1-2 hours until firm.</li>
            <li>With damp hands, roll teaspoon-size balls of truffle mixture and place on a tray. Freeze for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, melt white chocolate melts in a heat-proof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water.</li>
            <li>Remove truffle balls from freezer. One at a time, dip balls in melted chocolate to coat, allowing excess to drip off. Place on a tray lined with non-stick baking paper. When you have coated all of the balls and the chocolate coating has set, spoon remaining melted chocolate into a zip-lock bag. Snip a tiny corner off the end and drizzle over truffles to create ‘bandages’. Usewriting icing to dot on eyes.</li>
